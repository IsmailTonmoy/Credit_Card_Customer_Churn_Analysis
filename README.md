# Credit_Card_Customer_Churn_Analysis

# Project Description

The Credit Card Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to analyze and track customer churn for a financial institution’s credit card services. It provides valuable insights into why customers leave, who is most likely to churn, and when churn occurs most frequently. This dashboard helps the organization understand and predict churn patterns, allowing them to implement proactive retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce the financial impact of customer exits.

# Business Questions:

1. What is the overall churn rate for credit card customers?   

2. What is the breakdown of exit customers by gender and credit type?

3. Which geographical locations have the highest customer churn rates?

4. What is the relationship between customer activity and churn?

5. How does the churn rate of credit card holders compare to non-credit card holders?

# Business Objectives:

1. Analyze churn by customer demographics and credit types.

    * Identify high-risk groups for targeted intervention.

2. Design retention programs for specific geographic regions.

    * Implement location-specific strategies to reduce churn rates in countries like France, Germany, or Spain.

3. Monitor and improve the performance of existing customer engagement programs.

    * Use data to determine whether current programs are effective in reducing churn, especially for inactive members.

4. Develop and implement a loyalty program for credit card holders.

    * Since credit card holders form a large portion of the customer base, ensure retention strategies are geared toward retaining them through perks or rewards.

5. Improve communication strategies with at-risk customers.

    * Identify early warning signals for churn and proactively engage with at-risk customers to prevent them from leaving.

# Business Goals:

  1. Reduce overall customer churn rates.
        * Identify trends and patterns to design retention strategies aimed at decreasing the number of customers leaving the service.

  2. Improve customer engagement and loyalty.
        * Use insights from active vs. inactive member trends to focus on customer engagement initiatives that will improve retention.

  3. Tailor marketing strategies based on customer demographics and credit type.
        * Develop targeted retention campaigns for specific customer segments (by gender, location, and credit type) more likely to churn.

  4. Increase customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.
        * Understand why customers with specific credit types or in certain regions are leaving and address those issues with improved customer service or product offerings.

# key Insights From Dashboard

#### 1. Total Customers and Membership Status:

  * The company has 10,000 total customers, with 5,151 active members and 4,849 inactive members.
  * Nearly half the customer base is inactive, which could be a significant factor in the churn rate. Inactive members might be more likely to leave, indicating a need for re-engagement strategies.

#### 2. Churn Overview:

   * 2,037 customers have exited, while 7,963 customers have been retained.
   * A significant portion of the customer base is at risk of churn, with more than 20% of total customers leaving.
    Retaining more customers is crucial to preventing revenue loss, especially since a large portion of the churn seems to come from inactive members.

#### 3. Churn by Gender:

  * 55.92% of customers who churned are male, while 44.08% are female.
  * Male customers appear to be churning at a slightly higher rate than females. This might indicate that customer satisfaction or engagement among male customers needs to be investigated further.

#### 4. Churn by Credit Type:

   * Customers with a “Fair” credit score have the highest churn (685 exits), followed by "Poor" credit (520 exits) and “Good” credit (452 exits).
   * Customers with very good or excellent credit scores have the lowest churn rates, with only 252 exits for “Very Good” and 128 exits for “Excellent”.
   * This suggests that customers with lower credit ratings are more prone to exit. Offering personalized products or better financial guidance to this segment could help reduce churn.

#### 5. Churn by Month:

  * November and December had the highest number of exits, with 1,437 and 1,409 customers exiting, respectively.
  * The churn rate drops significantly starting from February, suggesting that specific periods (e.g., end of the year) have higher churn.
  * Investigating the reasons behind these spikes (e.g., dissatisfaction during holiday spending, poor customer service during peak times) could help prevent high churn in these months.

#### 6. Churn Trends Over Time:

  * There was a sharp decline in churn after January, with exits steadily dropping from 831 in February to much lower numbers during the middle of the year.
  * However, small spikes occurred again in April (674 exits) and July (653 exits).
  * Understanding what causes these fluctuations, such as seasonal behaviors or product issues, could help maintain a more consistent retention rate.

#### 7. Active vs. Inactive Member Churn:

  * The churn analysis shows a significant difference between active and inactive members.
  * The data indicates that inactive members are exiting at a much higher rate, emphasizing the need for reactivation efforts to engage these customers before they churn.

#### 8. Geography/Location (Filtered Insights):

  * While the overall dashboard covers all geographies, applying filters could reveal which country (France, Germany, Spain) has the highest churn rate.
  * This could lead to region-specific strategies to improve retention based on localized insights (e.g., customer preferences, economic conditions).

#### 9. Credit Card Holders vs. Non-Credit Card Holders:

  * 7,055 customers are credit card holders, while 2,945 are non-credit card holders.
  * Analyzing the churn rate between these two groups could show whether credit card holders are more loyal or if they require more targeted retention strategies.
